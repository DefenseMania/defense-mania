##### directory structure

DefenseMania is splitted into 3 parts: desktop application and android application, browser/web application. They share most of the code. The shared code is located in `src/shared` as well as all the assets. Everything is symlinked (relatively) into the 3 parts of DefenseMania. If you want to recreate the symlinks, run `./src/symlinks.sh`.

##### build it

1. Desktop: open the desktop project in processing and export the application.
2. Android: open processing, export the android project from the file menu, run `cd src/android && ant`, this will create the file `src/android/application.android/DefenseMania-unsigned.apk`.
3. Browser: run `cd src/browser && ant`, this will create the compiled and minified project in `src/browser/application.web`.

### Maps & Map Editor

1. Download the DM Map Editor from [here](https://github.com/DefenseMania/defense-mania-map-editor/releases) and read [how to use it](https://github.com/DefenseMania/defense-mania-map-editor#how-to-use-the-editor).
2. You can submit new maps via pull-requests in **this** repository.
